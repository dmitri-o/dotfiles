# -------------------------- KEYS
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code
# To test what a key is, run cat and then press the key:
# $ cat
# ^[[A  == arrow Up
# ^[[B  == arrow Down
# ^[[D  == arrow Left
# ^[[C  == arrow Right
# ^[[5~ == Page Up
# ^[[6~ == Page Down
# To get a list of which escape sequences correspond to which keyboard-keys,
# you can use a command such as
# $ infocmp -L -1
# $ infocmp -L -1 xterm

# When tab-completing, show a menu.
TAB: menu-complete
"\e[Z": menu-complete-backward

# Use Alt/Meta + Delete to delete the preceding word
"\e[3;3~": kill-word

## Search in history
# Match the current input in history when pressing UP or DOWN
# CTRL-UP and CTRL-DOWN to do partial search
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward
"\C-P": history-search-backward
