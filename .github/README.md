An attempt to follow [XDG specifications](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) and store config files in ``${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}``.

A list of config files will grow with time. Also will reflect changes in system wide files (from ``/etc/`` dir)

## Makefile
This is my memory aid.

The ``Makefile`` will be staying @ ``$HOME``

## TODO
The progress is reflected in my [TODO](TODO.md) list
