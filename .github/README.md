A few config files backed up here.

__Applications should follow [XDG specifications](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) and store config files in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME.__
I use [yadm](https://yadm.io/) to backup and restore them.




## Software in use and to backup their settings
  * Makefile (my aid for memory loss)
* Terminal
  * bash
  * tmux
  * ~~vim~~ / neovim
  * app-misc/mc
  * htop
* X11
   * allacritty
