An attempt to follow [XDG specifications](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) and store config files in ``${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}``.

I would like to keep my enviroment with minimal dependences, plugins and such, and keep well commented if possible.

A list of config files will grow with time. Also I will include changes in system wide files (from ``/etc/`` dir)

## Installation via copy paste of the following command:
### for BASH:
``curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vyvox/dotfiles/master/getdotfiles.sh | sh && source .config/bash/bashrc``

### for ZSH:
``curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vyvox/dotfiles/master/getdotfiles.sh | sh && source .config/zsh/.zshrc``

## Makefile
This is my memory aid.

The ``Makefile`` will be staying @ ``$HOME``

## TODO
The progress is reflected in my [TODO](TODO.md) list
