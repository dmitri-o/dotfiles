# dotfiles

An attempt to follow [XDG specifications](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) and store config files in ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME``.

A list of config files will grow with time. Also will reflect changes in system wide files (from ``/etc/`` dir)

## Makefile
This is my memory aid.

The ``Makefile`` will be staying @ ``$HOME``

### TODO
I'm going to add all of the config bootstapping in to the makefile snippet
to bootstrap with yadm, so it will be 

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmitri-o/dotfiles/master/Makefile

make homedir
```
